# From Scratch Website - A charity that uses art to help children express themselves

## The Project

This project was to help me learn NextJS and Contentful. I decided to build a charity website for this project as these types of websites are usually filled with lots of different information and I wan't to render as many different data types as possible to get the hang of using Contentful with NextJS. All the data is coming from Contentful and the site is being hosted by Vercel.
